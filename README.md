Decision Trees are a machine learning algorithm that simulates human decision-making by recursively splitting datasets based on key features. Random Forest Classifiers, an ensemble method, enhance predictive accuracy by combining multiple Decision Trees trained on different data subsets and feature samples. This randomness mitigates overfitting and increases robustness. Implementation involves data preprocessing, tree construction, prediction, and evaluation, with the option to fine-tune hyperparameters. The approach is versatile, offering interpretability in decision-making while leveraging the strength of ensemble learning for improved performance.
