# Healthcare Dataset Analysis and Stroke Prediction

## Project Overview:

This project focuses on the analysis and prediction of strokes using a healthcare dataset. Stroke is a critical health event, and predicting its occurrence can aid in early intervention and preventive measures. The dataset includes diverse information about individuals, encompassing demographic details, health conditions, and lifestyle factors.

## Key Steps:

### 1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
- **Loading Data:** The dataset is loaded using Pandas from a CSV file, and preliminary exploration is performed.
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values in the 'bmi' column and dropping unnecessary columns ('id' and 'avg_glucose_level').

### 2. Feature Engineering and Visualization:
- **Label Encoding:** Converting categorical variables to numeric using `LabelEncoder`.
- **Outlier Detection:** Visualizing outliers in the 'bmi' column through boxplots.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Creating a heatmap to understand feature relationships.
- **Distribution Visualization:** Plotting histograms for the distribution of 'bmi'.

### 3. Handling Imbalanced Data:
- **SMOTE Technique:** Applying Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) for oversampling to address class imbalance in the 'stroke' variable.

### 4. Machine Learning Models:
- **Decision Tree Classifier:** Implementing a Decision Tree model to predict strokes.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** Utilizing SVM with a linear kernel for prediction.
- **Random Forest Classifier:** Implementing an ensemble method, the Random Forest Classifier.

### 5. Model Evaluation and Interpretation:
- **Data Splitting:** Splitting the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
- **Model Evaluation Metrics:** Assessing model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports.
- **Visualizing Decision Trees:** Displaying the decision tree structure for interpretability.

### 6. Usage and Contribution:
- **Code Usage:** Providing instructions for running the code and exploring the results.
- **Acknowledgments:** Crediting data sources and contributors.
- **License Information:** Specifying the project's license for use and modification.

## Next Steps:
- Further optimization and fine-tuning of models based on performance metrics.
- Exploration of additional features or external datasets for enhanced prediction.
- Deployment of the predictive model for real-time stroke risk assessment.
